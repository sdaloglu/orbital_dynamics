# Orbital Dynamics Simulation

**Course**: PHY4905: Computational Physics  
**Semester**: Spring 2022  
**Authors**: Sabahattin Mert Daloglu

## Project Description

This project implements a numerical simulation of orbital dynamics to model the behavior of celestial bodies under gravitational forces. The simulation solves differential equations describing the motion of planets and other orbiting objects using Python libraries for numerical integration and visualization.

The simulation also includes various visualizations and outputs of the orbital paths, allowing for detailed analysis of the simulated trajectories.

## Notebooks

- `simulation.ipynb`: Contains the core implementation of the orbital dynamics simulation visualizations.
- `DiffEq.ipynb`: Contains the numerical solutions and methods for differential equations used to model the orbital dynamics.

## Dependencies

The project relies on the following Python libraries:

- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Math
- ImageIO
- OS

These libraries are used for numerical computations, plotting, image processing, and handling system-level operations.
